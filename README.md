**IMPORTANT**

this is a script that helps you find you're coordinates. this is really good for making script to teleport from one location to another, all u gotta do is use the following code

game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character.HumanoidRootPart.CFrame = CFrame.new(value)

paste the coordinates as the value and then you're done
